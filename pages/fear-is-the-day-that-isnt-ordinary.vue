Fear is the Day that Isn’t Ordinary
</h2>

<p>It is not the alarm clock and the coffee</br>
and the work. It is not this morning,</br>
when I read poems and had time 
</br>
to shave the hair growing from the backs 
</br>
of my knees. For a long time, I watched 
</br>
a sparrow shoveling water out of the birdbath, 
</br>
using his bill like the bucket of a bulldozer. 
</br>
I ate apples I pulled from the tree. 
</br>
This morning I watched the news. I saw 
</br>
the kennels we’ve built to hold the others—</br>
the children and the mothers and the fathers—</br>
and I know that I can decide I don’t want to 
</br>
travel, which is another way to lose. 
</br>
I can afford to stay in one place. It is a luxury 
</br>
to call a home home. To see your name 
</br>
on a gravestone. To know the local words 
</br>
for <i>first light</i> and <i>water</i> and <i>help</i>.</br>
To look at the apple’s skin and not see</br>
a map or a shroud. I know where I belong 
</br>
at least some of the time. I know there is a jar 
</br>
parked on a mountain high above the border 
</br>
between Arizona and Mexico. It holds 
</br>
notes—the voices of hikers and star-gazers 
</br>
who followed a canyon wren off the trail. 
</br>
It is full of the ordinary past—weather, 
</br>
dates, names. Nothing special, nothing 
</br>
like what those bodies hold, crossing 
</br>
below it. Sometimes, on an ordinary day, 
</br>
I think of the fact of it, hovering over the desert 
</br>
like its own country, those dispersals 
</br>
casually trusted to the earth, the way we offer 
</br>
bits of ourselves to the air when we sing.</p>
