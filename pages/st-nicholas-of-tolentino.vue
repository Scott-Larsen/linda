St. Nicholas of Tolentino Confronts His Moral Ambivalence in the Buffet Line  
</h2>
<!-- 	<div class="date">October 7, 2014</div> -->
<p>I grow weary seeing the vegetables,<br />
boiled and cut, mashed, rubbed in oil</p>
<p>to within an inch of their pretty skins.<br />
I have loved each one of them. Roots</p>
<p>hanging down into dirt as if the ground<br />
held an eave of icicles. I tremble</p>
<p>at their dark reach. The carrotâ€™s orange<br />
oblivion, the hoops of lavender around</p>
<p>the turnip head. Or the shiny froth of kale,<br />
the way a cabbage cups its holy center.</p>
<p>I am not removed from their fanciful<br />
life. I shuffle my tray along the line,</p>
<p>scooping warmed-over sides<br />
onto my plate. I think of the garden,</p>
<p>the hot pink weight of a beet in hand.<br />
I do not understand how this hunger</p>
<p>can be so easy. How I can suffer the leeks<br />
to be sliced and scalded. How I do not</p>
<p>wither at the sight of the cucumber,<br />
peeled back to its wet interior.</p>
<p>We settle our needs at our peril. I find<br />
myself blaming the soul for language.</p>
