Fear is the Day that Isn’t Ordinary
</h2>

<p>It is not the alarm clock and the coffee</p>
<p>and the work. It is not this morning,</p>
<p>when I read poems and had time 
</p>
<p>to shave the hair growing from the backs 
</p>
<p>of my knees. For a long time, I watched 
</p>
<p>a sparrow shoveling water out of the birdbath, 
</p>
<p>using his bill like the bucket of a bulldozer. 
</p>
<p>I ate apples I pulled from the tree. 
</p>
<p>This morning I watched the news. I saw 
</p>
<p>the kennels we’ve built to hold the others—</p>
<p>the children and the mothers and the fathers—</p>
<p>and I know that I can decide I don’t want to 
</p>
<p>travel, which is another way to lose. 
</p>
<p>I can afford to stay in one place. It is a luxury 
</p>
<p>to call a home home. To see your name 
</p>
<p>on a gravestone. To know the local words 
</p>
<p>for <i>first light</i> and <i>water</i> and <i>help</i>.</p>
<p>To look at the apple’s skin and not see</p>
<p>a map or a shroud. I know where I belong 
</p>
<p>at least some of the time. I know there is a jar 
</p>
<p>parked on a mountain high above the border 
</p>
<p>between Arizona and Mexico. It holds 
</p>
<p>notes—the voices of hikers and star-gazers 
</p>
<p>who followed a canyon wren off the trail. 
</p>
<p>It is full of the ordinary past—weather, 
</p>
<p>dates, names. Nothing special, nothing 
</p>
<p>like what those bodies hold, crossing 
</p>
<p>below it. Sometimes, on an ordinary day, 
</p>
<p>I think of the fact of it, hovering over the desert 
</p>
<p>like its own country, those dispersals 
</p>
<p>casually trusted to the earth, the way we offer 
</p>
<p>bits of ourselves to the air when we sing.</p>
