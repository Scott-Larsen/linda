<p><strong>Cooper Dillon Books Press Release, San Diego, CA</strong> - <i>Fearn</i> by Linda Dove is a collection where Fear is transforming, and doesn’t just become, but is a spectrum of objects, actions, and sensations. Fear is not some thing that’s crushing a person, or destroys the world like a weapon. "It learns/ to wait, it's metal a hole of slack," a part of nature, dynamics, and an essential creating element of the world. These are poems of moments when fear is something that’s vulnerable and even evocative of a sympathy. <i>Fearn</i> is a force, but one that’s just like anything else, and is only a part of all the other motions in this universe, "it holds our bodies open like a bag stuffed with raked leaves.”</p>
