In Defense of Objects (I)
</h2>

<p>An object…makes infinity private.<br />
—Joseph Brodsky, <em>Watermark</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlikely winters: San Francisco and its trolley<br />
car stuck in snow, Bangkok blizzard white.</p>
<p>Flakes shake to life, bright and insular. Cities<br />
fade in the blur of a handmade storm.</p>
<p>Despite the dizzying effects, the eye rests<br />
there, at home in beauty’s small arcade.</p>
<p>No sirens sound, no police sew their yellow<br />
threads to streets. The past collects</p>
<p>on souvenirs, turning kitsch to treasure.<br />
When the Wedgwood knife falls</p>
<p>to the floor, shards of blue shed like tears.<br />
Yet the eye is safe here, in pieces.</p>
<p>The Christmas ball shatters to an inner life<br />
of mirrors. It’s what confounds the mendicant:</p>
<p>the object’s pull, the need for pockets to keep<br />
stuff in. What amounts to wonder lurks in things,</p>
<p>whole or broken, near, as distant as the gray<br />
gargoyle where the eye’s balloon comes to rest.</p>
<p>Rusted keys, horseshoe, rust itself, color of burnt<br />
sienna. The word itself: <em>burnt sienna</em>.</p>
<p>Petals pool beneath a tree. In morning light,<br />
the snow globe glows like a translucent papoose.</p>
